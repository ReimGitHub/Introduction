# Introduction

A brief introduction of myself and why I am starting this profile

I am a Structural Engineer by training, passionate about problem solving through analysis. 
During my time as a Structural Engineering PhD student, I conducted numerous simulations, analytical calculations and designs that can all be done more efficiently with some help from AI. My industry experience involves analysis and forensic investigations for structural designs and failures, which usually require processing of large amounts of data (documents and drawings), followed by solving equations with multiple variables from the conditions in the real world with various amounts of uncertainty and probability of occurrence. As I have gathered sufficient experience about the fundamentals of this line of work, I feel ready to start a new path by utilizing AI and deep learning methods to a facilitate solving and decision making for a number of recurring problems. In other words, I am hoping to stop doing the work and help people and the industry to gain more efficiency by applying AI and deep learning methods.
